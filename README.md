## 📖 Game Overview

**Racing Rivals: Hare vs Tortoise** is a multiplayer 2D platformer that reimagines the classic fable. Unlike traditional platformers where characters work together, players compete against each other with unique abilities and disadvantages:

### 🐇 Hare
- **Faster** movement speed
- Can **jump** over obstacles and water bodies
- Cannot swim (falls into water = restart)
- Speed lag when encountering cushions (nap time!)
- Can drop pebbles to obstruct the Tortoise

### 🐢 Tortoise
- Slower default movement speed
- **Cannot jump** over obstacles
- Can **swim** through water (with speed boost!)
- Can **push** obstacles out of the way
- Push mechanic allows clearing obstacles dropped by the Hare

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

- **Competitive Racing**: First to the finish line wins
- **Asymmetric Abilities**: Each character has unique strengths and weaknesses
- **Obstacle Interaction**: Create obstacles for your opponent
- **Environmental Elements**: Water bodies, pits, and cushions affect each character differently

## 🕹️ Controls
